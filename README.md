# Analysis-genomic-aberrations
final project for the course at the University of Trento

You can find the scripts used for the analysis in the `sripts` folders. 

Scripts are ordered via their file name and they should be executed in that order. 
This is to ensure all required files for each analysis will be preset. 
You may need to adapt the sripts to your workspace directories.
